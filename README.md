RemoteTech is my capstone project.  It is designed to automate some manual tasked that are performed at what was my current employer.  It has three functions.  One to perform a weekly vehicle check.  The second is to submit a parts request.  Next is a function to capture information and an image of the receipt following a fuel purchase.  The final function was to complete some online testing.  This function currently is not complete.
The application was built with the Django framework.  All of the front-end rendering is HTML and CSS.
